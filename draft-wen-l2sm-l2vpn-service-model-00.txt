              A YANG Data Model for L2VPN Service Delivery
                 draft-wen-l2sm-l2vpn-service-model-00

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver a
   Layer 2 Provider Provisioned VPN service.

   This model is intended to be instantiated at management system to
   deliver the overall service.  This model is not a configuration model
   to be used directly on network elements, but provides an abstracted
   view of the Layer 2 VPN service configuration components.  It is up
   to a management system to take this as an input and use specific
   configurations models to configure the different network elements to
   deliver the service.  How configuration of network elements is done
   is out of scope of the document.

   The data model in this document includes support for point-to-point
   Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWS) and multipoint Virtual Private
   LAN services (VPLS) that use Pseudowires sgnaled using the Label
   Distrbution Protocol (LDP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) as
   described in RFC4761 and RFC6624.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Tree diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is presented
   in Section 5.

   The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write), and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" or "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Definitions

   This document uses the following terms:

   Service Provder (SP):  The organization (usually a commercial
      undertaking) responsible for operating the network that offers VPN
      services to clients and customers.

   Customer Edge (CE) Device:  Equipment that is dedicated to a
      particular customer and is directly connected to one or more PE
      devices via attachment circuits.  A CE is usually located at the
      customer premises, and is usually dedicated to a single VPN,
      although it may support multiple VPNs if each one has separate
      attachment circuits.  The CE devices can be routers, bridges,
      switches, or hosts.

   Provider Edge (PE) Device:  Equipment managed by the SP that can
      support multiple VPNs for different customers, and is directly
      connected to one or more CE devices via attachment circuits.  A PE
      is usually located at an SP point of presence (PoP) and is managed
      by the SP.

   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS):  A VPLS is a provider service
      that emulates the full functionality of a traditional Local Area

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Sevice Model             September 2016


      Network (LAN).  A VPLS makes it possible to interconnect several
      LAN segments over a packet switched network (PSN) and makes the
      remote LAN segments behave as one single LAN.

   Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS):  A VPWS is a point-to-point
      circuit (i.e., link) connecting two CE devices.  The link is
      established as a logical through a packet switched network.  The
      CE in the customer network is connected to a PE in the provider
      network via an Attachment Circuit (AC); the AC is either a
      physical or a logical circuit.  A VPWS differs from a VPLS in that
      the VPLS is point-to-multipoint, while the VPWS is point-to-point.
      In some implementations, a set of VPWSs is used to create a multi-
      site L2VPN network.

3.  The Layer 2 VPN Service Model

   A Layer 2 VPN service is a collection of sites that are authorized to
   exchange traffic between each other over a shared infrastructure of a
   common technology.  This Layer 2 VPN service model (L2SM) provides a
   common understanding of how the corresponding Layer 2 VPN service is
   to be deployed over the shared infrastructure.

   This document presents the L2SM using the YANG data modeling language
   [RFC6020] as a formal language that is both human-readable and
   parsable by software for use with protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241]
   and RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf].

   This service model is limited to VPWS and VPLS based VPNs as
   described in [RFC4761] and [RFC6624].

3.1.  Applicability of the Layer 2 VPN Service Model

   The L2SM defined in this document applies to both point-to-point
   (E-Line) and multipoint-to-multipoint (E-LAN) carrier Ethernet
   services.

   Over the past decade, Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) has published a
   series of technical specifications of Ethernet virtual circuit
   service attributes and implementation agreements between providers.
   Many Ethernet VPN service providers worldwide have adopted these MEF
   standards and developed backoffice tools accordingly.

   Rather than introducing a new set of terminologies, the L2SM will
   align with existing MEF attributes when it's applicable.  Therefore,
   service providers can easily integrate any new application that
   leverages the L2SM data, Service Orchestrator for example, with
   existing BSS/OSS toolsets.  Service providers also have the option to

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Sevice Model             September 2016


   generate L2SM data for current L2VPN customer circuits already
   deployed in the network.

3.2.  Layer 2 VPN Service Types

   A Layer 2 VPN circuit can be port-based; in which case any service
   frames received from subscriber within contractual bandwidth will be
   delivered to the corresponding remote site, regardless of customer
   Vlan value (C-tag) of the incoming frame.  The service frames can
   also be native Ethernet frames without C-tag.  In this scenario, only
   one Ethernet Virtual Circuit (EVC) is allowed on a single provider to
   subscriber link.

   Contrary to the above use case, incoming customer service frames may
   be split into multiple EVCs based on pre-arrangement between the
   service provider and customer.  Typically, C-tag of the incoming
   frames will serve as the service delimiter for EVC multiplexing over
   the same provider to subscriber interconnection.

   Combining the service-multiplexing attribute with point-to-point
   verses multipoint-to-multipoint connection type, a Layer 2 VPN
   circuit may fall under one of the following service types:

   o  E-Line services: Point-to-Point Layer 2 connections.

      EPL:  In its simplest form, a port-based Ethernet Private Line
         (EPL) service provides a high degree of transparency delivering
         all customer service frames between UNI-to-UNI interfaces using
         All-to-One Bundling.  All unicast/broadcast/multicast packets
         are delivered unconditionally over the EVC.  No service
         multiplexing is allowed on an EPL UNI interface.

      EVPL:  On the other hand, Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL)
         service supports multiplexing more than one Point-to-Point, or
         even other virtual private services, on the same UNI interface.
         Ingress service frames are conditionally transmitted through
         one of the EVCs based upon pre-agreed C-tag to EVC mapping.
         EVPL supports multiple C-tags to one EVC bundling.

   o  E-LAN services: Multipoint-to-Multipoint Layer 2 connections.

      EP-LAN:  Ethernet Private LAN Service (EP-LAN) transparently
         connects multiple subscriber sites together with All-to-One
         Bundling.  No service multiplexing is allowed on an EP-LAN UNI
         interface.

      EVP-LAN:  Some subscriber may desire more sophisticated control of
         data access between multiple sites.  Ethernet Virtual Private

         LAN Service (EVP-LAN) allows connecting to multiple EVCs from
         one or more of the UNI interfaces.  Services frame disposition
         is based on C-tag to EVC mapping.  EVP-LAN supports multiple
         C-tags to one EVC bundling.

3.3.  Layer 2 VPN Service Network Topology

   Figure 1depicts a typical service provider's physical network
   topology.  Most service providers have deployed an IP, MPLS, or
   Segment Routing (SR) multi-service core infrastructure.  Customer
   Edge (CE) devices are placed at customer premises as demarcation
   points to backhaul in profile service frames from the subscriber over
   the access network to the Provider Edge (PE) equipment.  The actual
   transport technology or physical topology between CE and PE is
   outside the scope of the L2SM model.

   From the subscriber perspective, however, all the edge networks
   devices are connected over a simulated LAN environment as shown in

3.4.  Layer 2 VPN Ethernet Virtual Circuit Construct

   The base model of EVC is shown in Figure 3.

   Subscriber edge network device (C) connects to the service provider's
   CE equipment.  The link between C and CE devices is referred as User
   Network Interface (UNI).  For clarification, this is called UNI-C on
   subscriber side and UNI-N on provider side.

   The service provider is obligated to deliver the original service
   frame across the network to the remote UNI-C.  All Ethernet and IP
   header information, including (but not limit to) source and
   destination MAC addresses, EtherType, Vlan (C-tag), Class-of-Service
   marking (802.1p or DSCP), etc.

   In coming service frames are first examined at UNI-N based on C-tag,
   Class-of-Services identifier, EtherType value.  Conforming packets
   are then metered against the contractual service bandwidth.  In-
   profile packets will be delivered to the remote UNI via the Ethernet
   Virtual Circuit (EVC), which spans between UNI-N to UNI-N.

   When both CEs are located in the same provider's network, a single
   operator maintains the EVC.  In this case, the EVC consists only one
   Operator Virtual Circuit (OVC).

   Typically, the CE device at customer premises is a layer 2 Ethernet
   switch or NID.  Service provider may choose to impose an outer Vlan
   tag (S-tag) into the received subscriber traffic following 802.1ad
   Q-in-Q standard, especially when Layer 2 aggregation devices exist
   between CE and PE.

   The uplink from CE to PE is referred as Internal Network-to-Network
   Interface (I-NNI).  When 802.1ad Q-in-Q is implemented, Ethernet
   frames from CE to PE are double tagged with both provider and
   subscriber VLANs (S-tag, C-tag).

   Most service providers have deployed MPLS or SR multi-service core
   infrastructure.  Ingress service frames will be mapped to either
   Ethernet Pseudowire (PWE) or VxLAN tunnel PE-to-PE.  The details of
   these tunneling mechanism are at the provider's discretion and not
   part of the L2SM.

   Service provider may also choose Seamless MPLS approach to expand the
   PWE or VxLAN tunnel between UNI-N to UNI-N.

   Service provider may leverage multi-protocol BGP to auto discover and
   signal the PWE or VxLAN tunnel end points.

   Nevertheless, the remote site may be outside of the provider's
   service territory.  In this case, the provider may partner with the
   operator of another metro netork to provider service to the off-net
   location as shown in Figure 4.

   The first provider owns the customer relationship, thus the end-to-
   end EVC.  The EVC is comprised of two or more OVCs.  Partially of the
   EVC is an OVC from local UNI-C to the inter-provider interface.  The
   provider will purchase an Ethernet Access (E-Access) OVC from the
   second operator to deliver p acket to the remote UNI-C.

   The inter-connect between the two operators edge gateway (EG) devices
   is defined as the External Network-to-Network Interface (E-NNI).

4.  Service Data Model Usage

   The L2VPN service model provides an abstracted interface to request,
   configure and manage the components of a L2VPN service.  The model is
   used by a customer who purchases connectivity and other services from
   an SP to communicate with that SP.

   A typical usage is for this model to be an input for an orchestration
   layer that is responsible for translating it into configuration
   commands for the network elements that deliver/enable the service.
   The network elements may be routers, but also servers (like AAA)
   necessary within the network.

   The configuration of network elements may be done usiing the Command
   Line Interface (CLI), or any other configuration (or "southbound")
   interface such as NETCONF [RFC6241] in combination with device-
   specific and protocol-specific YANG models.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Sevice Model             September 2016


   This way of using the service model is illustrated in Figure 5 and
   described in more detail in [I-D.wu-opsawg-service-model-explained].
   The usage of this service model is not limited to this example: it
   can be used by any component of the management system, but not
   directly by network elements.

   The usage and structure of this model should be compared to the Layer
   3 VPN service model defned in [I-D.ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model].

5.  Design of the Data Model

   The YANG module is divided in three main containers : customer-info,
   vpn-services, and sites.

   The customer-info defines global parameters for a specific customer.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Sevice Model             September 2016


   The vpn-svc container under vpn-services defines global parameters
   for the VPN service for a specific customer.

   A site is composed of at least one uni-site or one enni-site.

   Authorization of traffic exchange is done through what we call a VPN
   policy or VPN topology defining routing exchange rules between sites.

5.1.  Overview of Main Components of the Model

   The L2SM model is structured in a way that allows the provider to
   list multiple circuits of various service types for the same
   subscriber.

5.1.1.  Customer Information

   The "customer-info" container contains essential information to
   identify the subscriber.

   "customer-account-number" is an internal alphanumerical number
   assigned by the service provider to identify the subscriber.  It MUST
   be unique within the service provider?s OSS/BSS system.  The actual
   format depends on the system tool the provider uses. "customer-name"
   is in more readable form.

   Subscriber operation center and main contact number are also listed
   here for reference purpose.

5.1.2.  VPN Service Overview

   The "svc-type" container contains two optional leaves: one for EVC
   (Ethernet Virtual Connection) and the other one for OVC (Operator
   Virtual Connection).  These two parameters are not mutually
   exclusive.  Depending on the service-type, a Layer 2 VPN service may
   be identified by EVC-ID, OVC-ID, or both.

   E-Line and E-LAN provider shall have EVC-ID assigned to the UNI-to-
   UNI circuit.  If the service has remote UNIs in off-net partner's
   network, there will be one OVC-ID for the on-net segment between
   local UNI to the E-NNI interconnect, and one OVC-ID for each off-net
   segment from E-NNI to the remote UNI.  E-Access, on the other hand,
   is OVC-based service.  The E-Access service provider will assign OVC-
   ID for the circuit between UNI to E-NNI.

   The "svc-type" container can be augmented in the future to support
   other new technologies.  Note that the "svc-id" should be
   corresponding to the "svc-type".

5.1.2.1.  Service Type

   The "svc-type" container contains two cases, one for EVC (Ethernet
   Virtual Connection), the other for OVC (Operator Virtual Connection).
   It can be used to indicate the type of service pipe type.  The model
   user also can augment the "svc-type" container with other cases to
   support future technologies.  Notes that the "svc-id" should be
   corresponding to the "svc-type".

5.1.2.1.1.  EVC

   The "evc"case contains an "evc-id" leaf with boolean type.  The "evc-
   id" leaf will be marked TRUE for E-Line and E-LAN service types.  And
   the "svc-id" will be associated with the "evc-id".  Only one "evc-id"
   is allowed for each "svc-id".

   The EVC ID is intended to be a structured string.  Each service
   provider can decide the nomenclature in its network.  For example,
   many carriers in North American have implemented the COMMON LANGUAGE?

   Special Service Circuit Codes (CLCI S/S Codes) - Serial Number
   Format, which is defined in defined in ANSI ATIS-0300097.

5.1.2.1.2.  OVC

   The "ovc" case contains two boolean subcases: "on-net-ovc" and "off-
   net-ovc".

   For E-Access or services with off-net UNIs, the "on-net-ovc" leaf
   MUST be marked TRUE.  And the "on-net-ovc-id" will be specified.

   In case of E-Access, the "svc-id" will be associated with the "on-
   net-ovc-id".  Only one "on-net-ovc-id" is allowed for each "svc-id".

   If the service is E-Line or E-LAN with remote UNIs, there will be
   one, and only one, "on-net-ovc-id" and a list of "off-net-ovc-id"s
   for the remote UNIs.  However, the "svc-id" is still associated with
   the "evc-id".  Only one "evc-id" is allowed for each "svc-id".  New
   ovc type could be added by augmentation.

5.1.2.2.  ethernet-svc-type

   The "ethernet-svc-type" group contains all supported Ethernet service
   types.  One, and only one, "ethernet-svc-type" must be selected for
   each "svc-id".

   The current supported Ethernet service types are listed in section
   3.2.  New service types can be added in the future.

5.1.2.3.  Metro Network Partition

   Some servicer providers may divide their network into multiple
   administrative domains.  And a Layer 2 VPN service may span across
   more than one metro network of the same service provider.  The
   optional "metro-network-id" container is intended be used by these
   multi-domain providers to differentiate intra-market vs.  inter-
   market service.

   When the "inter-mkt-service" leaf is marked TRUE, multiple associated
   "metro-mkt-id"s will be listed.  Otherwise, the service is intra-
   domain and only one "metro-mkt-id" is allowed.

5.1.2.4.  vpn-signaling-option

   The "signaling-option" container captures service-wide attributes of
   the L2VPN instance.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Sevice Model             September 2016


   Although topology discovery or network device configurations is
   purposely out-scoped from the L2SM model, certain VPN parameters are
   listed here nevertheless.  The information here can then be passed to
   other elements in the whole automation eco-system, such as the
   configuration engine, which will handle the actual service
   provisioning function.

   The "signaling-option" list uses "name" and "type" combination as the
   key.  The "name" leaf is a freeform string of the VPN instance name.
   The "type" leaf is for the signaling protocol: BGP-L2VPN, BGP-EVPN,
   or T-LDP.

5.1.2.4.1.  BGP L2VPN

   [RFC4761] and [RFC6624] describe the mechanism to auto-discover L2VPN
   VPLS/VPWS end points (CE-ID or VE-ID) and signal the label base and
   offset at the same time to allow remote PE to derive the VPN label to
   be used when sending packets to the advertising router.

   Due to the auto-discovery natural, PEs that have at least one
   attachment circuit associated with a particular VPN service do not
   need to be specified explicitly.

   In the L2SM model, only the target community (or communities) will be
   listed at the service level.

   The "type" leaf under "mp-bgp-l2vpn" is an identityref to specify
   "vpws" or "vpls" sub-types.

5.1.2.4.2.  BGP EVPN

   Defined in [RFC7432], EVPN is a new promising L2VPN technology based
   upon BGP MAC routing.  It's considered the next generation L2VPN
   solution that provides similar functionality of BGP VPWS/VPLS with
   improvement around redundancy, multicast optimization, provisioning
   and simplicity.

   Due to the auto-discovery natural, PEs that have at least one
   attachment circuit associated with a particular VPN service do not
   need to be specified explicitly.

   In the L2SM model, only the target community (or communities) will be
   listed at the service level.

   The "type" leaf under "mp-bgp-evpn" is an identityref to specify
   "vpws" or "vpls" sub-types.

5.1.2.4.3.  LDP Pseudowires

   [RFC4762] specified the method of using targeted LDP sessions between
   PEs to exchange VC label information.  This requires a manually
   define a full mesh of targeted LDP sessions between all PEs.

   As multiple attachment circuits may terminate on a single PE, this
   PE-to-PE mesh is not a per site attribute.  All PEs related to the
   L2VPN service will be listed in the "t-ldp-pwe" with associated "vc-
   id".

5.1.2.4.4.  PWE Encapsulation Type

   Based on [RFC4448], there are two types of Ethernet services: "Port-
   to-Port Ethernet PW emulation" and "Vlan-to-Vlan Ethernet PW
   emulation", commonly referred to as Type 5 and Type 4 respectively.
   This concept applies to both BGP L2VPN VPWS/VPLS and T-LDP signaled
   PWE implementions.

   The "pwe-encapsulation-type" container contains two Boolean type
   leaves: "ethernet" and "ethernet-vlan", only one should be marked
   TRUE if "signaling-option" is "mp-bgp-l2vpn" or "t-ldp-pwe".

5.1.2.4.5.  PWE MTU

   During the signaling process of BGP-l2vpn or T-LDP pseudowire, the
   pwe-mtu value is exchanged and must match on both ends.  By default,
   the pwe-mtu is derived from physical interface MTU of the attachment
   circuit minus the EoMPLS transport header.  In some cases, however,
   the physical interface on both ends of the circuits may not have
   identical MTU settings.  For example, due to 802.1ad q-in-q
   operation, I-NNI interface will need extra four bytes to accommodate
   the S-tag.  The inter-carrier E-NNI link may also have a different
   MTU size then the internal network interfaces.

   [RFC4448] requires same MTU size on physical interface on both end of
   the pseudowire.  In actual implementations, many router vendors have
   provided the knob to explicitly specify the pwe-mtu, which can then
   be decoupled from the physical interface MTU.

   When there's a mismatch between the physical interface MTU and
   configured pwe-mtu, "allow-mtu-mismatch" knob is also required in
   many cases.

   The optional "pwe-mtu" container is for this purpose.

5.1.2.4.6.  Control Word

   A control word is an optional 4-byte field located between the MPLS
   label stack and the Layer 2 payload in the pseudowire packet.  It
   plays a vital role in Any Transport over MPLS (AToM).  The 32-bit
   field carries generic and Layer 2 payload-specific information,
   including a C-bit which indicates whether the control word will
   present in the Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) packets.  If the C-bit is
   set to 1, the advertising PE expects the control word to be present
   in every pseudowire packet on the pseudowire that is being signaled.
   If the C-bit is set to 0, no control word is expected to be present.

   Whether to include control word in the pseudowire packets MUST match
   on PEs at both ends of the pseudowire and it's non-negotiable during
   the signaling process.

   Control-word applies to both BGP L2VPN VPWS/VPLS and T-LDP signaled
   PWE implementions.  It is a routing-instance level configuration in
   many cases.

   The optional "control-word" leaf is a Boolean field in the L2SM model
   for the provider to explicitly specify whether control-word will be
   signaled for the service instance.

5.1.2.5.  Load Balance Option

   As the subscribers start to deploy more 10G or 100G Ethernet
   equipment in their network, the demand for high bandwidth Ethernet
   services increases.  Along with the great revenue opportunities,
   these high bandwidth service requests also pose challenges on
   capacity planning and service delivery in the provider's network.
   Especially when the contractual bandwidth is at, or close to, the
   speed of physical link of the service provider's core network.
   Because of the encapsulation overhead, the provider can not deliver
   the throughput in the service level agreement over a single link.
   Although there may be bundled Nx10G or Nx100G aggregation links
   between core network elements, or Equal Cost Multiple Paths (ECMP) in
   the network, an EoMPLS PWE or VxLAN circuit is considered a single
   flow to a router or switch which uses the five tuples in the hashing
   algorithm.

   Without burdening the core routers with additional processing of deep
   inspection into the payload, the service provider now have the option
   of inserting flow or entropy label into the EoMPLS frames, or using
   different source UDP ports in case of VxLAN/EVPN, at ingress PE to
   facility load-balancing on the subsequent nodes along the path.  The
   ingress PE is in a unique position to see the actual unencapsulated

   service frames and identify data flows based on the original Ethernet
   and IP header.

   On the other hand, not all Layer 2 Ethernet VPNs is suited for load-
   balancing across diverse ECMP paths.  For example, a Layer 2 Ethernet
   service transported over a single RSVP signaled LSP will not take
   multiple ECMP paths.  Or if the subscriber is concerned about
   latency/jitter then diverse path load-balance can be undesirable.

   The optional "load-balance-option" container is intended to capture
   the load-balance agreement between the subscriber and provider.  If
   the "load-balance" Boolean leaf is marked TRUE, then one of the
   following load-balance methods can be selected: "fat-pw", "entropy-
   label", or "vxland-source-udp-port".

5.1.2.6.  SVLAN ID Ethernet Tag

   Service providers have the option of inserting an outer Vlan tag (the
   S-tag) into the service frames from the subscriber to improve service
   scalability and customer Vlan transparency.

   Ideally, all external interfaces (UNI and E-NNI) associated with a
   given service will have the same S-tag assigned.  However, this may
   not always be the case.  Traffic with all attachments using different
   S-tags will need to be "normalized" to a single service S-tag.  (One
   example of this is a multipoint service involves multiple off-net
   OVCs terminating on the same E-NNI interface.  Each of these off-net
   OVCs will have a distinct S-tag, which can be different from the
   S-tag used in the on-net part of the service.)

   The purpose of the optional "svlan-id-ethernet-tag" leaf is to
   identify the service-wide "normalized S-tag".

5.1.2.7.  CVLAN ID To EVC MAP

   When more than one services are multiplexed on the same UNI
   interface, ingress service frames are conditionally transmitted
   through one of the EVC/OVCs based upon pre-arranged customer VLAN to
   EVC mapping.  Multiple customer VLANs can be bundled across the same
   EVC.

   "cvlan-id-to-evc-map", when applicable, contains the list of customer
   vlans to the service mapping in a freeform format.  In most cases,
   this will be the vlan access-list for the inner 802.1q tags (the
   C-tag).

5.1.2.8.  Service Level MAC Limit

   When multiple services are provided on the same network element, MAC
   address table, and RIB space for MAC-routes in case of EVPN, are
   shared common resource.  Service providers may impose a maximum
   number of MAC learned from the subscriber for a single service
   instance, and specify the action when the upper limit is violated:
   drop the packet, flood the packet, or simply send a warning log
   message.

   For point-to-point services, if MAC learning is disabled then MAC
   limit is not necessary in this kind of implementation.

   The optional "service-level-mac-limit" container contains the
   subscriber MAC address limit and exceeding action information.

5.1.2.9.  Service Protection

   Sometimes the subscriber may desire end-to-end protection at the
   service level for applications with high availability requirements.
   There are two protection schemes to offer redundant services:

   o  1+1 protection: In this scheme, the primary EVC or OVC will be
      protected by a backup EVC or OVC, typically meet certain
      diversified path/fiber/site/node criteria.  Both primary and
      protection circuits are provisioning to be in forwarding state.
      Subscriber may choose to send the same service frames across both
      circuits simultaneously.

   o  1:1 protection: In this scheme, a backup circuit can be
      provisioning to the primary circuits.  Depending on the
      implementation agreement, the protection circuits may either
      always be in forwarding state, or only become active when
      detecting a faulty state or the primary circuit.

   The optional "service-protection" container hereby is to capature the
   desired service protection agreement between subscriber and provider.

   An "peer-evc-id" should be specified when the "protection-model" has
   value.

5.1.3.  site

   A site represents a connection of a customer location to one or more
   VPN services.  In l2 vpn service model, we present two kinds of site:
   UNI (User network interfaces) site and ENNI (External Network to
   Network Interface) site.

6.  Service Model Usage Example

7.  Interaction with Other YANG Modules

   As expressed in Section 4, this service module is not intended to
   configure the network element, but is instantiated in a management
   system.

   The management system might follow modular design and comprise at
   least two different components:

   a.  The component instantiating the service model (let's call it the
       service component)

   b.  The component responsible for network element configuration
       (let's call it the configuration component)

   In some cases when the split is needed between the behavior and
   functions that a customer requests and the technology that the
   network operator has available to deliver the service [I-D.wu-opsawg-
   service-model-explained].  A new component can be separated out of
   the service component (let's call it the control component).  This
   component is responsible for network-centric operation and is aware
   of many features such as topology, technology, and operator policy.
   As an optional component, it can use service model as input and is
   not required if the control component delegates its control
   operations to the configuration component.

   In the previous sections, we provided some example of translation of
   service provisioning request to router configuration lines as an
   illustration.  In the NETCONF/YANG ecosystem, it is expected that
   NETCONF and YANG will be used between the configuration component and
   network elements to configure the requested service on those
   elements.

Internet-Draft             L2VPN Sevice Model             September 2016


   In this framework, it is expected that YANG models will be used for
   configuring service components on network elements.  There will be a
   strong relationship between the abstracted view provided by this
   service model and the detailed configuration view that will be
   provided by specific configuration models for network elements.
   Service components needing configuration on network elements in
   support of the service model defined in this document include:

   o  VRF definition including VPN policy expression.

   o  Physical interface.

   o  Ethernet layer (VLAN ID).

   o  QoS : classification, profiles, etc.

   o  Routing protocols : support of configuration of all protocols
      listed in the document, as well as routing policies associated
      with these protocols.

   o  Multicast Support.

   o  Ethernet Service OAM Support.

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] or NETCONF protocol
   ([RFC6241].  The lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the
   transport-layer protocol provides both data integrity and
   confidentiality, see Section 2 in [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] and
   [RFC6241].  The client MUST carefully examine the certificate
   presented by the server to determine if it meets the client's
   expectations, and the server MUST authenticate client access to any
   protected resource.  The client identity derived from the
   authentication mechanism used is subject to the NETCONF Access
   Control Module (NACM) ([RFC6536]).  Other protocols to access this
   YANG module are also required to support the similar mechanism.

   The data nodes defined in the "ietf-l2vpn-svc" YANG module MUST be
   carefully created/read/updated/deleted.  The entries in the lists
   below include customer proprietary or confidential information,
   therefore only authorized clients MUST access the information and the
   other clients MUST NOT be able to access to the information.

10.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Qin Wu and Adrian Farrel for facilitating work on the
   initial revision of this document.

   This document has drawn on the work of the L3SM Workng Group
   expressed in [I-D.ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model].

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new URI from the IETF XML registry
   ([RFC3688]).  The following URI is suggested:



       URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc
       Registrant Contact: L2SM WG
       XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace



   This document also requests a new YANG module name in the YANG Module
   Names registry ([RFC6020]) with the following suggestion:



       name: ietf-l2vpn-svc
       namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l2vpn-svc
       prefix: l2vpn-svc
       reference: RFC XXXX
